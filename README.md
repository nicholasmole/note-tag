# note-tag

Title pending note taker with tags that open 

## Concept

Make a note application that runs with Electron and React.

One tab is note. 
. Maybe make notes have folders

Second tab has tags so
. When a user adds like tag:: :; the inner area makes a new file called
   "tag"

Third tab has timer so
. When a user adds timername@@ today 2pm      
  in a line it will automatically understand what your timer is trying
   to  and make a notification accordingly.
